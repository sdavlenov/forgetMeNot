Joe Estudiante

Details
--------------
Joe Estudiante is a CUNY student who works a full time job.  His major is Information Systems.  His school work consists of homework assingments, tests, and projects.  He is a travel agent in a very busy travel agency.  The tasks for his job include booking hotels and activities for various clients.  His job, as well as his school work are both demanding and keeping track of his tasks due dates has become very difficult.
Goals
---------
Joe wants to keep up with his school work and finish his degree as well as keep his clients happy by providing timely customer service.

Problem Scenarios
=================
Joes client base has recently grown.  Joes clients can sometimes be flaky when deciding when to leave and what activities to do.  Joe also has trouble prioritizing his schoolwork as it is difficult to keep up with his assignments due dates.  Joe panicks when having to book clients activities last minute and wishes he could orginize his tasks by time sensitivity.


Current Alternatives
--------------------
Joe feels bad when he has to depend on his co-workers to book trips for his clients.  Turning in his assingments late also has an effect on Joes grades.

Value Proposition
=================
Being able to fill up his schedule according to priority will help Joe greatly.  Having constant reminders what assignments are due soon, and what clients are set to leave in the near future will help Joe organize his time efficiently.  Keeping all the tasks on a Notepad app on his iPad is not sufficient enough as there is no reminders.  He also forgets to remove the tasks he has completed so checking if he has done them wastes a lot of time.

User Stories
=============
I want an app that will help me prioritize my tasks, lets me edit the tasks, and erases the tasks when they are completed.

Acceptance Stories
===================
Given that Joe forgets his assignment due dates, and dates his clients choose to leave for vacation, the app will be organized into categories **title** and **description** and **level**.  The program will show ALL the upcoming tasks also organized by categories of **level** for importance.  There will be 3 categories for urgency levels. If it is an important task, the urgency level will be **Important**.  If it is sort of important, the level will be **Medium**.  Finally if its is not very urgent but you want to remember it, the level will be **Unimportant**.

Given that Joe will want to remove tasks he has completed off his list, he will have the option to delete them once they are done.  A simple **delete** command will ask Joe what item he wants to delete of his list.  Joe can choose to leave the tasks there as well.

Given that Joe might want to edit a previous task he put into his reminders, he will have the option with the **edit** command.  This will allow him to edit any aspect of the task.
